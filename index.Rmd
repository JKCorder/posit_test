# What is policy evaluation? {-}

This reading supplements Chapter 10, "Policy Implementation, Failure and Learning" from @birkland2019.  

Birkland defines and discusses **evaluation** briefly in a section of that describes the key role of Congress in **oversight**.  This brief definition of evaluation shows in the chapter

>**evaluation** The process of investigating whether and to what extent a program has its desired effects

Evaluation also comes up in the stages model. In Chapter 2, Birkland identifies evaluation as the last stage in the policy process, with feedback moving the issue back to towards the agenda.

What exactly is evaluation, what forms does evaluation take, and how does evaluation work in practice?


## What do we measure as we evaluate program performance? {-}

What types of data inform policy choices in your policy area?

Who collects and publishes this data?

Before describing who does evaluation and how, two distinctions about measurement and observation are important:

- **Outputs** (what agencies do) are different than **outcomes** (what we care about)

- There are two different dimensions of impact: direct and indirect outcomes (each with benefits and costs) - details below

## Who does policy evaluation? {-}

There is an entire policy evaluation industry

- Universities (WMU Evaluation Center)
- Media (investigative journalism)
- Private research organizations (501c3) 
- Private research organizations - contractors (RAND)
- Government agencies - monitoring and assessment
- Congressional committees (hearings)
- Commissions (Financial Crisis Inquiry)
- Congressional Research Service and Government Accountability Office

This reality - many actors with many tools and often competing objectives and values - suggests that *policy learning* is a good way to approach the evaluation stage.  Learning doesn't just happen in agencies, lots of actors have a stake and the form that learning takes can privilege or foreclose particular policy alternatives and benefit particular actors.

## How is evaluation different from other types of policy analysis? {-}

Most programs, in the ordinary course of business, collect data about outputs - what bureaucrats are doing, who is impacted, and how funds are distributed or spent. This type of program monitoring or performance measurement is one type of analysis.  Are actions consistent with plans? This is a routine agency function.

Other more complex forms of analysis include assessment and evaluation

Program assessment is linking program outcomes to intended goals or objectives.  Program assessment requires some systematic way to map or link outputs to outcomes, implying some agreed upon metric for outcomes and resources to measure and report those metrics.  

Program evaluation uses a deliberate and systematic research design to learn about the costs and impact of programs, leveraging insights about experiments and field research to uncover causal links between program interventions and outcomes in the target population

### Program assessment{-}

Program assessment complements program monitoring or performance measurement - with perhaps additioinal reporting requirements and new metrics - but the idea is to build collection and monitoring of outcome measures into agency practice.  Work of this form u Used to be required under the Government Performance and Results Act (1993) and was routinely published as part of the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) under Clinton and Bush.  The PART was not continued under the Obama, Trump or Biden administration

Assessment is one tool for policy analysis: how is a current program working?

### Program evaluation{-}

Program evaluation basis very basic questions about implementation – from @KRA1997: “what you plan to do, how you plan to do it, and who it is you want to reach.”

We typically think that an agency will have good handle on the costs of progam, but less clear information about performance:  Have you achieved the results/outcomes you expected?”

For a detailed example of how evaluation works see: @KRA1997  “A Guide to Evaluating Crime Control of Programs in Public Housing.  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

The KRA document maps out the reasons why evaluation can be useful for an agency, as well as some the challenges of implementation work

## Why take the step to formally evaluate? {-}

- Understand benefits
- Demonstrate benefits
- Improve performance
- Share information

## What types of information do we collect? Accounting for costs and benefits {-}

Direct costs and benefits affect the target population.  Indirect costs and benefits affect people oustide of the target population

### Direct (target population) {-}

Direct benefits are the *intended* effects of intervention 

Action can also have *unintended* consequences (positive or negative)

Spillover effects (positive or negative).  A positive example education has a positive spillover to health and civic engagement (confined to target population, and not really unintentional)

Programs can have direct costs - the costs to the target population can include time and effort to participate in a program.  (Program overhead costs are passed on taxpayers - an indirect cost borne by people outside the target population)

### Indirect (not target population) {-}

Programs may have *externalities*  For example, economic development may displace economically vulnerable groups (a negative externality)

Indirect costs (cost of program operation, spread over many people)

Opportunity costs (cost of not directing resources to other problems)

Symbolic or intangible benefits and costs


### How do we account for costs and benefits over time? {-}

Future versus present value and the challenge of fair value accounting

How do you balance the benefits of some future outcome with a current cost?  The answer is a *discount rate*.  What is a discount rate?  The annual percentage that a future payment is reduced to obtains its present value.   Is the appropriate discount rate the government cost of borrowing funds from the future? (today, low; 1980, very high) or the private costs of borrowing?

Consider the implication:

If the discount rate is high, meaning we don’t care much about future costs or income, then we would use a policy design that has low upfront costs and high long term costs

If the discount rate is low, meaning we value future income and costs, then we would use a puts costs into the present and benefits off into the future.

Seemingly arcane, technical choices like the appropriate level of the discount rate determine whether a program is viewed as too costly or a good investment.  The Biden White House sketched out the implications for Medicaid funding costs:



```{r pic4, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Picture4.png")
```

This from the Council of Economic Advisers "Valuing the Future: Revision to the Social Discount Rate Means Appropriately Assessing Benefits and Costs" (27 February 2024)

### Accounting for health impacts {-}

What is the economic benefit of a longer human life? 

Can you use a future potential earning stream as a proxy for value? This has very perverse implications for how we consider climate change, for instance.

Costs of climate change responses are borne by the developed world, consumers of fossil fuel contribute to world economy.

Costs of climate change itself – flooding and other – are borne by the developing world, where economic impact of individuals may be very small.


## Concerns about evaluation {-}

This list is from @KRA1997

Diverts agency resources from services to other functions

Has workload implications for street-level bureaucrats

Too complicated, especially compared to program monitoring

Risks of negative findings

Monitoring in another form, so duplicates effort 


## Research design in evaluation {-}

### Experimental research {-}

Random assignment to treatment or control

Ethical dilemmas related to provision of service

Costs of research 

Benefit: Potential for program improvement and cost containment

### Example: JTPA experimental evaluation {-}

### An example: Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) programs 

An early and compelling example of this type of research involved an evaluation of Job Training and Partnership Act (JTPA) programs in the late 1980s.  The JTPA programs offered classroom training, on-the-job training, or job search assistance to people who are out of work.  In September, 1987, two-thirds of the eligible population who applied to the program were directed to services, one-third were deferred for 18 months.  Do training and services offered to the unemployed increase earnings?  The results are summarized in the two figures below.

Figure 1  **Estimated effects of JTPA programs on earnings**

Women 21 and over

```{r jhr1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bloom19971a.png")
```

Women 18-20

```{r jhr2c, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bloom19972a.png")
```

Reproduced from @bloom1997.  “The Benefits and Costs of JTPA Title II-A Programs….”

The results are remarkable.  The benefits of the program for adult women were large: they had persistent positive differences in earnings.  Women who got the service earned more money (and paid more taxes!) in the long run.  The program worked.  But the benefits were not observed for younger women – these services did not work.  A sensible response to this evaluation would be to design different services for younger women and enroll as many adult women as possible in order to produce long-term earnings gains for as many unemployed older women as possible.  

### Quasi-experimental {-}

Compare outcomes in similar places with different policy choices

### Example: Connecticut highway speed initiative in 1956 {-}

Traffic fatalities spiked in 1955 and the state initiated an aggressive speed limit enforcement effort in 1956

Did it work?

```{r pic2, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Picture2.png")
```

From @campbell1968

### Before-and-after {-}

Weak alternative to experiment of any form. 

Many things change after (Post hoc ergo prompter hoc fallacy).  

Example: size of banks pre and post Dodd Frank.  Did the passage of financial reform legislation lead to the consolidation in banking sector, few very large banks?

Another complication: problems drive intervention. If only areas with the problem adopt the solution, then it appears that the solution caused the problem

Example: What is the link between the death penalty and crime?  How might the choice of policy intervention (death penalty) depend on the severity of the problem (crime)?  

### What’s new? {-}

Have you seen the movie *Moneyball*? The idea of the film (Brad Pitt stars!) is that a baseball franchise with few resources uses statistical models to identify players who are likely to perform well but are currently not in lucrative contracts. The manager composes a team of inexpensive overlooked talent that becomes highly competitive. The data scientists – statisticians – make judgments about player potential that are superior to the instincts or intuitions of experienced scouts and coaches. This approach is now used throughout Major League Baseball and has extended to other professional sports. For an NBA example, see @silver_nba. Federal executives have advocated that a similar approach inform the allocation of tax dollars to programs. In a recent book, *Moneyball for Government*, Jim Nussle and Peter Orzag argue that federal agencies should invest substantial resources in program evaluation, in order to ensure that scarce tax dollars are used in the most effective way. The tools of data science and social science can be used to identity federal programs that offer effective solutions to pressing problems [@nussle].  “Top tier evidence” is the standard. Here is an example:


```{r pic1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Picture1.png")
```


Big data – using existing large-scale administrative data sources to understand program impacts. This relies on thethe major Federal Statistical Agencies (FSAs).  What are those agencies?

```{r pic3, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Picture3.png")
```


Machine learning and AI – using algorithms to learn about program performance and guide program innovation



## Policy analysis broadly defined {-}

Monitoring, assessment, and evaluation are all about the performance of *current* programs.  

What about *prospective* evaluation of alternatives (models, forecasts, cost-benefit analysis)?

What about historical and comparative evaluation (other times, other countries)?

Combination of academic and private research – typically not contract work or agency work – inform the second and third questions

## After analysis: what happens? {-}

- end the program: Program termination confronts many obstacles (constituencies within and outside of government)

- reform the program: reform is more likely  - triggering problem definition, development of alternatives, and a predictable cycle of reform and re-reform

- do nothing: this is very common  (actors with a stake in program operation prefer to ignore evaluation - this means policy learning never translates into organizational learning)
